#Introduction

Welcome to the Cohere+AWS Workshop! In this hands-on workshop, we'll be exploring the latest techniques and tools for natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). We'll be focusing on two powerful techniques: prompt engineering and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. By the end of this workshop, you'll have a deep understanding of how to apply these techniques to build and leverage the power of Cohere and AWS services to bring your projects to life.

#What you will learn:

The basics of prompt engineering and how to design effective prompts to improve the performance of your large language models (LLM).
Understanding of the RAG model and its applications, including information retrieval and text generation
Hands-on experience with Cohere's state-of-the-art LLM ‘Command’ models and AWS services for building and deploying AI solutions
Best practices for integrating Cohere and AWS services to create robust and scalable AI workflows
