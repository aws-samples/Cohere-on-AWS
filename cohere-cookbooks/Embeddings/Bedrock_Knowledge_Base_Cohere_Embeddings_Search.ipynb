    "# Using Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock, Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, and Cohere Embed\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "This notebook builds on the content in the [Text Embeddings using Cohere LLM stored in Amazon OpenSearch Serverless](https://github.com/aws-samples/Cohere-on-AWS/blob/main/cohere-cookbooks/Embeddings/Cohere_Embeddings_Search.ipynb) notebook. Amazon OpenSearch Serverless allows developers to run petabyte-scale workloads without configuring, managing, and scaling OpenSearch clusters. OpenSearch Serverless delivers millisecond response times with the simplicity of a serverless environment, making it ideal as a vector store for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Using OpenSearch also allows developers to take advantage of visualization and monitoring through OpenSearch Dashboard features that developers may already be familiar with. In addition, OpenSearch Serverless is cost-effective because you only pay for the resources you consume. There is no need for upfront provisioning and overprovisioning for peak workloads. OpenSearch Serverless also automatically updates your collections to consume the latest bug fixes, features, and performance improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the AWS ecosystem, there are different ways to use Amazon OpenSearch Serverless. One way is to use Amazon OpenSearch Serverless as a vector store within a [Knowledge Base for Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/). A Knowledge Base is fully managed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capability that allows you to connect to foundation models (FMs) to deliver more relevant, context-specific, and accurate responses. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on using the Cohere Embed Multilingual V3 LLM (Large Language Model) to create embedings stored in a Knowledge Base for Amazon Bedrock powered by an Amazon OpenSearch Serverles vector store. The goal is to help developers generate accurate responses without performing undifferentiated steps to implement RAG. \n",
